            <p>A bill to make public the long-awaited Epstein files was signed by President Trump on November 19, 2025. These files have been a topic of major controversy in the past year, and after much request and debate over their publication, the House passed a bill to release the files last Tuesday, receiving a 427-1 vote. Later, it received a unanimous vote in the Senate, and was then signed by Trump. The DOJ now has until December 19th to unclassify all Epstein documents, but have the right to redact information that may conflict with active investigations, as well as to protect victim identities.</p>

            <p>While most have heard the term “Epstein files,” not everyone is informed of their exact content. Jeffrey Epstein was a billionaire known for his powerful connections, ranging from former British prince Andrew Windsor to current president Donald Trump. In 2019, he was charged with sex trafficking, but he committed suicide two months after his arrest, and his trial was dismissed. His arrest unveiled a nearly two-decade-long trafficking system, where Epstein flew children to his private island and invited other men and women to take part in illicit activities. After Epstein’s arrest, rumors about which individuals attended his island ran wild, with speculation surrounding prominent politicians, billionaires, and celebrities.</p>

            <p>Various names have created a scandal in the past years, with debate over their relationship with Epstein and their involvement in his affairs. From former U.S. presidents to runway models, Epstein's web of connections was incredibly extensive and diverse. Even though speculative claims circle many politicians, no one has been prosecuted for their involvement with Epstein except Ghislaine Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in jail for aiding in the recruitment of victims as young as 13 years old.</p>

            <p>Contrary to popular belief, the Epstein files are not direct lists with names of scandalous figures that visited the island. According to the Associated Press, the files will likely be composed of “notes and reports written by FBI agents; transcripts of witness interviews, photographs, videos and other evidence; Epstein’s autopsy report; and some material that may already be public, such as flight logs and travel records.”</p>

            <p>The impending release of the Epstein files will bring about never-before-seen documents that are sure to bewilder the U.S. public, but some believe it will not be as scandalous as conspiracy theorists would hope, since part of the files have already been released through Congress. Additionally, when asked what would be in the files, PBS News stated, “Records related to the aborted Florida investigation, the Manhattan investigations, and anything else the Justice Department did to examine Epstein’s dealings in the time in between.”</p>

            <p>In essence, there is much speculation and misinformation about the Epstein case, leading to greater uncertainty about its contents. In times of critical investigation, our society tends to prefer scandal over truth, and we must ensure this is not the case with the Epstein files. Victims of his abuse need closure, and to secure it we must focus on the facts and not controversy.</p>
