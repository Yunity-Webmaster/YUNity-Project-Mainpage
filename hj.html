                <h2><strong>Founder, President, Chief Reporter</strong></h2>
                <p><strong>"A capacity to change is indispensable. Equally indispensable is the capacity to hold fast to that which is good."</strong></p>
                <p>-John Foster Dulles, 52nd US Secretary of State</p>
                <p>This is the guiding quote for my journey.</p>
                <p>As an academically advanced student, I pride myself on being up to date on all the world's current events. My passion for international relations and politics began long before my academic career. Even in elementary school, I had many questions for my teacher about who ran the country.  As I started high school, I began to mature this passion and dig deep into the world of international relations. I have an academic record of not only taking government classes but also excelling in these classes. Over the summer between my sophomore and junior years, I had the privilege of attending Georgetown University's Summer Academy for International Relations. After returning from a wonderful 3-week excursion in Washington, DC, I was more motivated to pursue a career as a diplomat. Through ISM, I will display my depth of passion for international affairs and diplomacy. Through the YUNity Project, I aim to be at the forefront of the effort to reclaim our country from hyperpolarization and restore a period of calm, diplomatic governance.</p>
