        <div class="Shutdown Text"><p>On October 1st, 2025, the US federal government officially shut down after Congress failed to pass a continuing resolution funding the government. This article will break down everything you need to know about the 2025 federal government shutdown.</p>
            <p>First, the US fiscal year ends on September 30th and starts on the next day, October 1st. To continue funding in the federal government, the US Congress, which holds the power of the purse (meaning the power to set a budget), must pass a budget for the next fiscal year by September 30th. According to the Antideficiency Act, amended in 1950, no federal agency may spend funds that aren’t approved by Congress (Wessel). This means that no federal employee can authorize funds that have not been authorized by Congress yet. Although this law was meant to prevent misuse of federal funds, the law has recently been an obstacle to federal employees in working or providing support during government shutdowns.</p>
            <p>Although the current government shutdown is only partial, many aspects of the government will be different from normal operations. Some of the notable changes include the closure and suspension of certain national parks, Smithsonian museums (all will remain open until October 11), the suspension of CDC projects, and delays in airports due to a lack of TSA officers and air controllers (Zurcher). Other government services such as Social Security payments, Medicare, and the USPS will remain operational either in partial or in full.</p>
            <p>But how did the US get to this point? The answer lies with Congress’s lack of compromise on appropriations. Although the House of Representatives managed to pass a continuing resolution, HR 5371, by a 217-212 vote, the US Senate failed to reach the 60 votes necessary to pass a continuing resolution that would have funded the government past September 30th (Library of Congress). It is notable that it is easier in the House to pass a Continuing Resolution than in the Senate due to only a simple majority being needed. In the Senate, 60 votes are needed, not to simply pass a bill, but to end a filibuster and invoke cloture (Lau).</p>
            <p>According to a NPR/PBS News/Marist Poll survey, around 31% of Americans believe both sides are responsible for the government shutdown, whereas 38% blame the Republicans and 27% blame the Democrats (Marist Poll). The increasing partisan polarization has put many Americans on edge. More alarming is the White House’s public actions blaming the “radical left” for the government shutdown by posting on official government websites partisan language and encouraging public servants to include inflammatory language in their out of office emails - potentially in violation of the Hatch Act, which prohibits civil servants from engaging in political activities while on duty or inside federal buildings (Bond).</p>
            <p>The current government shutdown has alarmed many, as they categorize this as one with the potential for becoming the longest, most fiscally damaging shutdown in US history. Not only that, but misinformation is rampant in this shutdown. The GOP has misled the public by falsely accusing Democrats of wanting to extend healthcare benefits to illegal immigrants (Sullivan & Cowan). This is not the case. The Senate Democrats have offered that, in exchange for their support, the continuing resolution must expand healthcare subsidies to those who purchase insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Another key concession the Democrats are seeking is a reassurance to continue to give legal immigrants who already qualify for ACA coverage (Sullivan and Cowan). Republicans have stated that they are willing to negotiate on these issues only after a continuing resolution has been passed to fund the government until November.</p>
            <p>Regardless of a difference in policy positions, the current government shutdown harms all Americans. The White House has stated that civil servants should prepare for mass layoffs in the event of a prolonged shutdown (Zurcher). This announcement has been one of many that have left federal employees exasperated and uncertain about their future. The lack of compromise between both sides will have implications that are far-reaching across the country.</p>
            <p>The polarized state of the United States has led to this moment. In a time of critical compromise, the US Congress has demonstrated to the American public the lack of effective negotiations that occur in its halls. From a plethora of misinformation, hyperpolarization, and a lack of middle ground, the 2025 US federal government shutdown is one that departs from preceding shutdowns in a turn for the worse. All Americans, regardless of political affiliation, should pressure Congress to end the shutdown as quickly and as efficiently as possible.</p>
